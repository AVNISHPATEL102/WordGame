# WordGame

This is a normal word which we used as childrens.

This game is made in python and has it is a simple game the game is to be played in the output console of PyCharm(an IDE for python).

Currently the game is fully playable by a human and you can change the number of words and length of words and the grid and the difficulty level will increase by itself.

Our final goal is to make an AI which knows the words but finds the word in the most efficient way and the fastest way from a big matrix of display of letters.


Initial Goals:- 

->A display in which a person can find the words.

->Providing a display of letters as a perfect grid matrix view in the PyCharm output console.




Progress:-

->Done with the words and the letters thing.

->Done with the matrix for the display.

->Done with hiding the words.
